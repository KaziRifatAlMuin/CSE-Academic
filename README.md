# CSE Academic Repository

This repository contains resources, assignments, and projects from various Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) courses at KUET. It is intended as a collection of academic materials that I have worked on throughout my university studies.

## Courses Covered
- **Advanced Programming Lab [Java]**
- **Algorithm Analysis and Design**
- **Data Structures and Algorithms [DSA]**
- **Numerical Methods Lab**
- **Object-Oriented Programming [OOP]**
- **Structured Programming [C]**

## Structure
Each course is organized into folders containing lecture notes, assignments, and code implementations.

## Goals and Usage
The main objective of this repository is to serve as a reference for students looking to enhance their understanding of key CSE concepts. It can be used to review programming paradigms, explore algorithms, and practice lab assignments. I hope this repository helps others with their academic coursework and self-study.
