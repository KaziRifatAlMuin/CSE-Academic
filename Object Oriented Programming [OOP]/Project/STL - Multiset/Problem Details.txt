Problem :
There is a super market in Dhaka city. There are N shops. Each shop sells a some amount of chocolates.
Let the number of chocolates in the shop be a1, a2, a3, ... , an and each of them is priced 1 taka.
Each shop owner brings new chocolates with double price after selling all the chocolates from the shop.
i.e. If the shop owner has 10 chocolates initially, after selling all he will buy 5 more chocolates of price 2 taka.
Then after selling all of them, he will buy 2 more chocolates of price 4 taka. After selling all, he will buy 1 more of 8 taka.

Rifat wants to buy maximum amount of chocolates from the market. But he can stay in the supermarket for K minutes.
To make each purchase, it takes one minute. And the shop owner instantly brings new chocolates with double price after selling all chocolates.
